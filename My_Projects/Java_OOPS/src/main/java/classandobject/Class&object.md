**CLASS AND OBJECT IN JAVA**

* In Java class and objects are the foundation of OOPS
* They help model real-world entities and organize code in a structured way

**JAVA Class:**

Java class is the blueprint or prototype where we can create objects, which defines the data and behavior of the object.

* Class consists of MODIFIERS, CLASS NAME, BODY
* The Class groups the fields and methods in a single unit.
* The Memory is allocated only when the object is instantiated.
* Contains Fields, Methods, Constructor, Nested Class, and Interfaces.

**JAVA Objects:**

Java Objects are the instance of the class created to access its data and operations.

* Each object holds its own, STATE, BEHAVIOR, METHOD, and IDENTITY

**Object Instantiation:**

1. Using new keyword (widely used)
2. Using Reflection (Used in teh frameworks like Spring)
3. Using clone() method (creates a copy of existing object)
4. Using De-serialization (technique of reading object from the saved state in the file. Object is recreated from the Stored Byte Stream)

**Object Class in Java**

* Object Class (in java.lang) is the root of java class hierarchy
* Every class in Java is directly or indirectly extends an object
* Supports Comparison, Debugging, Hashing, and Synchronization

**Object Class**
1. getClass() - Returns the class object, used to get the runtime class of the object (eg,java.lang.String)
2. hashCode() - Returns hash value of the object, Unique id generated by the JVM using getValue()
4. toString() - String representation of an object, used to convert object to String
5. clone() - Creates a new object, that is a copy of current object
6. equals() - Compares the given object with the current object, we acn override to create custom equality condition
7. finalize() - Invoked by the Garbage Collector just before the object is created, it runs when object has no reference, we can override finalize()

**Concurrency Methods**
8. wait()
8. notify()
9. notifyall()
