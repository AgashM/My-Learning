**POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA**

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in java, that allow objects to behave differently based on their specific class type. `Poly = many & Morph = forms`, means one entity can take many forms.

* Multiple Behavior - The same method can behave differently, depends on the object that calls this method.
* Method Overloading - The child class can redefine a method of its parent class
* Method overriding - We can define multiple methods on the same name with different parameters
* Runtime Decision - At runtime, java determines which method to call depending on object's actual class.

**Types of Polymorphism**
1. Compile time polymorphism - _Method Overloading_ also called as Static Polymorphism, works by changing the arguments in the same method.
2. Run time polymorphism - _Method Overriding_ also called as Dynamic Method Dispatch, called when method call is resolved at runtime.
